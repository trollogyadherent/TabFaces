## FAQ
### What it do?
It backports player faces in the tab menu.

### Client? Server? What side?
Server and client preferred. If installed on client only, you will only see faces of players that have come close enough to you, at least once.

### Will this work with [insert auth mod]?
First off, it won't work on offline servers. I have not tested, but probably anything modifying the authlib should work. Mods and plugins that let you register in offline mode won't do.
If this mod crashes your server, it probably means you are not in online mode :trolley:

### Will you port it to [insert abandonware version]?
It's free real estate. Do it (for free).

### How to build?
`gradlew build` should do the trick.
